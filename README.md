# act-values

## TODO

- [x] other values should move out of the way when dragging
- [x] you should be able to press the number for a tier when in the same tier to send the item to the back of it
- [x] when you press a number to add an item to a tier, it should go to the back
- [x] should not be able to move items between categories on the sidebar, or within a category, for simplicity. You can only drag it out of a category into a tier, or from a tier back to its home category. If you drag from a tier onto a random spot on the page (not another tier), it should return to its home category.
- [x] fixed: URL state and local storage store different things
- [ ] touch-friendlyness. I think to support touch, we could have a mode where you press on a tier, then every value you press on gets added to that tier. So you can fill it out ergonomically that way. This should only happen for touch displays, since dragging isn't ergonomic there
