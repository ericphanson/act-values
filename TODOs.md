# TODOs

- [ ] if you use a keyboard shortcut (or mobile click thing) to move an item from a higher tier to a lower one, it should go to the TOP of the lower tier. If you move it from a lower tier to a higher one, it should go to the BOTTOM of the higher tier. So it is a "minimal move". If it is within the same tier, it should go to the top of it.
- [ ] tablet UI isn't very good; mobile layout too big for swiping. Maybe use desktop UI but with better dragging abilities
- [ ] think harder about the text, instructions, naming, etc...

## Needs design

These need some design thought to make sure it works well and doesn't add too much complexity. And ultimately they might be out of scope.

- [ ] custom datasets
- [ ] custom values? maybe we could have the existing dataset but you can add a couple individual values
- [ ] "domains of life" organization: https://stevenchayes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/The-Valued-Living-Questionnaire.pdf
    - [ ] questionnaires? probably not

- [ ] localization


## Not sure

Not sure I want these, but they are some ideas I had.

- [ ] add desktop version of swipehint? with instructions
- [ ] should we add a tiny number in the corner of each value when its in a tier to show its place within it? I think not now
- [ ] rename "not important"? ("low priority"?). not sure- think it's valuable to let users express what they don't care about, but don't want to cause self-judgement
