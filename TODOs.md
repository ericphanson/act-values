# TODOs

- [x] if a list cannot be loaded from local storage, instead of crashing the app, clear it and print a toast letting the user know
- [ ] think harder about the text, instructions, naming, etc...
- [ ] accessibility improvements
- [ ] redesign quota UI: instead of 0/10, we don't really want to say you must have 10, we want to say no more than 10. Currently with the progress bar and 5/10 etc, it really communicates "get to 10".

## Needs design

These need some design thought to make sure it works well and doesn't add too much complexity. And ultimately they might be out of scope.

- [ ] custom datasets or more datasets
- [ ] custom values? maybe we could have the existing dataset but you can add a couple individual values
- [ ] "domains of life" organization: https://stevenchayes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/The-Valued-Living-Questionnaire.pdf
    - [ ] questionnaires? probably not

- [ ] localization


## Not sure

Not sure I want these, but they are some ideas I had.

- [ ] add desktop version of swipehint? with instructions
- [ ] should we add a tiny number in the corner of each value when its in a tier to show its place within it? I think not now
- [ ] rename "not important"? ("low priority"?). not sure- think it's valuable to let users express what they don't care about, but don't want to cause self-judgement
